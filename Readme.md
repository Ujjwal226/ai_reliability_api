# AI Reliability Dashboard - Engineer 3 (APIs & Serving)

##  Week 1 Deliverable
As **Engineer 3**, my role is to build APIs for serving ML models, monitoring system status, and managing releases.  
In **Week 1**, the focus was on setting up the foundation:

-  FastAPI project skeleton with modular folder structure  
- `/health` endpoint to check service availability  
- Local run setup (no Docker for now)  
- Verified functionality using **Swagger UI**
